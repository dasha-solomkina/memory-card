# Memory Card Game
This project was created to implement the concepts learned so far by using hooks to manage and utilize state while fetching and using data from an external API. The primary objective was to build a memory game that is both functional and visually appealing. This project was completed as part of the course: [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-memory-card). The code was written independently, without following any video or text tutorials, solely based on the concepts studied in the course.

## Key Features
- **Scoreboard**: Displays the current score and the best score achieved.
- **Card Shuffle**: Randomly shuffles cards whenever a user clicks on one and when the component mounts.
- **Image and Text Fetching**: Fetches images and text from an external API (Pokemon API).
- **Memory Cards**: Cards display images and text fetched from the API.
- **Tools**: React, Pokemon API, Vercel.
